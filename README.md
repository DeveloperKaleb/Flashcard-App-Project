## Flashcard App Project

React project in which a user can create a deck of cards to study with.

It could be used to study any number of topic because the user can input and edit the decks and the cards within the decks.

Upon opening the user is brought to a home page. There are multiple buttons which the user can click from here.

Users can view individual decks.

Users can also study individual decks, while doing so they can flip the card from "front" to "back".

There is currently not a live site hosting this app. More screenshots of functionality can be found in the screenshots folder and if anyone is interested I can deploy the app for functionality demonstration.
